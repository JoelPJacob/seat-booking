**Developer**: Joel P Jacob  
**Role**: Front End Developer

## Task Overview:
The Seat Booking System is a web application that allows users to view and select seats in a grid layout. Each seat has a price based on its row, and users can select up to 8 seats. The total cost of selected seats is displayed in the booking summary. The system provides an interactive UI where users can easily book their desired seats.

## Features Implemented:
- **Seat Grid**: Displays seats in a grid format with different colors representing different pricing tiers (Silver, Gold, Platinum).
- **Seat Selection**: Users can click to select seats, with up to 8 seats allowed at a time.
- **Pricing**: Seats are categorized into three pricing tiers: Silver (₹100), Gold (₹150), Platinum (₹200).
- **Booking Summary**: Shows the selected seats along with the total price for booking.
- **Interactive UI**: Seats change color when selected, and the total price is updated in real-time.
- **Responsive Layout**: The app is responsive, and the seat grid is displayed on the left with the booking summary on the right.

## Technologies Used:
- **React**: For building the interactive UI.
- **CSS**: For styling the seat grid and components.
- **JavaScript**: For managing state and functionality of the booking system.
