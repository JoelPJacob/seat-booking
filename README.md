## Task Overview
The Seat Booking System is a web application that allows users to view and select seats in a grid layout. Each seat has a price based on its row, and users can select up to 8 seats. The total cost of selected seats is displayed in the booking summary. The system provides an interactive UI where users can easily book their desired seats.

## Features Implemented
- **Seat Grid**: Displays seats in a grid format with different colors representing different pricing tiers (Silver, Gold, Platinum).
- **Seat Selection**: Users can click to select seats, with up to 8 seats allowed at a time.
- **Pricing**: Seats are categorized into three pricing tiers:
  - **Silver**: ₹100
  - **Gold**: ₹150
  - **Platinum**: ₹200
- **Booking Summary**: Shows the selected seats along with the total price for booking.
- **Interactive UI**: Seats change color when selected, and the total price is updated in real-time.
- **Responsive Layout**: The app is responsive, with the seat grid displayed on the left and the booking summary on the right.
